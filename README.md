# simple-carousel

It works only with webkit (otherwise it will work but a scrollbar will appear under each carousel)

It's not a library, just a code for me that I'll reuse in future, but it could be useful for anyone if they understand how does it work.
It's commented by the way, it's not too difficult to understand, I hope.
